# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Dynamic-Spectrum-Access

## Dependencies

1. tensorflow>1.0
2. matplotlib
3. python 3.x(windows)

### To install tensorflow ,follow the link [tensorflow - windows](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows) 
I recommend Installing with Anaconda 


### To train the DQN ,run on terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shkrwnd/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Dynamic-Spectrum-Access.git
cd Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Dynamic-Spectrum-Access
python train.py
```

To understand the code , I have provided jupyter notebooks:
1. How to use environment.ipynb
2. How to generate states.ipynb

To run notebook,run on terminal
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Default browser will open, just open ipynb files and run them
